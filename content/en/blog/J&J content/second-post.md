## The Eisenhower Method

The Eisenhower Method, also known as the Eisenhower Matrix or Urgent-Important Matrix, is a time management tool popularized by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States. This method helps individuals prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance, leading to more effective and efficient use of time.

The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Urgent and Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention and are crucial to your goals. These should be done right away.
2. **Important, Not Urgent**: Tasks that are essential but do not require immediate action. These should be scheduled for later.
3. **Urgent, Not Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention but are not crucial. These can often be delegated.
4. **Not Urgent, Not Important**: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important. These should be minimized or eliminated.

By categorizing tasks this way, the Eisenhower Method helps individuals focus on what truly matters, reduce stress, and improve productivity.
