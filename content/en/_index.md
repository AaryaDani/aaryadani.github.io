## **About Me**

Passionate and driven chemical engineering student with a focus on innovation and sustainability, graduating in May 2027. I excel at solving complex engineering challenges and thrive in collaborative environments. Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant conducting advanced cell culturing, electrospinning, biomaterial testing, immunolabeling, fluorescence imaging, and image processing. My coursework includes Honors Calculus, Honors Physics, and General Chemistry, providing a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of chemical engineering. I possess strong computer skills in C+, MATLAB, Python, R, Hugo, Terminal, and Microsoft Office, as well as extensive laboratory skills, including ELISA, Western Blotting, Southern Blotting, Gram Staining & Cloning, Mammalian Cell Culturing, CRISPR gene editing, 3-D Printing, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis. Additionally, I hold laboratory certifications in OSHA, CPR, and the CIT Program. Outside of academics, I have a keen interest in music production and video editing.
