During this rotation, I had the opportunity to work in Merck's Global Engineering Solutions team as a Delivery Co-Op. 

During my internship with the GES Delivery team, I gained hands-on experience across multiple project portfolios, including a new facility for Gardasil, renovation and construction projects across site, and quality initiatives throughout Merck's campuses. I performed regular field walks to assess construction progress, attended safety meetings and GEMBA walks, and submitted Safety Observation Reports to reinforce safety practices and build confidence in field interactions. These activities helped me identify construction wins and concerns, communicate effectively with contractors, and understand safety protocols in a live project environment.

Governance and project planning were also key areas of my learning. I supported stage gate activities, mapped equipment layouts, and updated EHSE checklists. I participated in strategic meetings such as SSRs and Tier reviews, which helped me understand business case development, stakeholder alignment, and project tier structures. Through these experiences, I built skills in scope definition, flow path design, and navigating governance frameworks within complex engineering projects.

In addition to safety and governance, I engaged in quality, digital innovation, and project controls. I contributed to cost avoidance tracking, supported AI-based quality assessments, and assisted with dashboards like the Knowledge Action Plan (KAP). I also conducted equipment analysis and attended scheduling meetings to understand construction milestones and resource planning. These experiences enhanced my technical proficiency in data visualization, regulatory compliance, and continuous improvement methodologies, preparing me for future roles in engineering and project delivery.
