  Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is a multinational corporation that produces medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and owns many consumer brands. Here are some of my experiences with the company. From June till August of 2024, I spent my time with Johnson & Johnson as a data science intern. I learned a variety of skills and completed multiple projects. Check out the biological concepts and the priorization method I utilized, as well as my final presentation!

# Eisenhower Method: 

The Eisenhower Method, also known as the Eisenhower Matrix or Urgent-Important Matrix, is a time management tool popularized by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States. This method helps individuals prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance, leading to more effective and efficient use of time.

The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Urgent and Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention and are crucial to your goals. These should be done right away.
2. **Important, Not Urgent**: Tasks that are essential but do not require immediate action. These should be scheduled for later.
3. **Urgent, Not Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention but are not crucial. These can often be delegated.
4. **Not Urgent, Not Important**: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important. These should be minimized or eliminated.

By categorizing tasks this way, the Eisenhower Method helps individuals focus on what truly matters, reduce stress, and improve productivity.

# Carvykti

Carvykti, also known as ciltacabtagene autoleucel, is a cutting-edge immunotherapy treatment designed for patients with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. It is a form of CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell) therapy, which involves genetically modifying a patient's T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells.

**Key Components of Carvykti Therapy:**

1. **Collection**: T-cells, a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune response, are collected from the patient’s blood through a process called leukapheresis.
2. **Modification**: The collected T-cells are then genetically engineered in a laboratory to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that specifically targets the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) found on the surface of multiple myeloma cells.
3. **Multiplication**: The modified T-cells are multiplied in the laboratory to create a sufficient number of CAR-T cells.
4. **Infusion**: The CAR-T cells are infused back into the patient’s body, where they seek out and destroy BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cells.

**Benefits of Carvykti:**

- **Targeted Therapy**: Carvykti specifically targets cancer cells, reducing damage to healthy cells.
- **Personalized Treatment**: As the therapy uses the patient’s own T-cells, it is highly personalized and tailored to each individual.
- **Efficacy**: Clinical trials have shown significant efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, offering hope to those who have not responded to other treatments.

**Considerations:**

- **Side Effects**: Patients may experience side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological toxicities, and other immune-related reactions.
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring by healthcare professionals is essential to manage and mitigate potential side effects.
- **Availability**: Carvykti is a specialized treatment available at select medical centers with expertise in CAR-T therapy.

Carvykti represents a significant advancement in the treatment of multiple myeloma, offering new possibilities for patients battling this challenging disease.
