      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am Aarya Dani! I currently attend the University of Pittsburgh, studying chemical engineering. In the summer of 2024, I completed an internship at Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, where I leveraged my skills to develop Hugo websites that effectively showcase diverse datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my engineering background, I am passionate about bridging the gap between engineering principles, data science insights, user requirements, and cutting-edge technology. Currently at Merck in their Vaccine Manufacturing Co-Op program, I hope to apply these skills in my future work.&lt;/p&gt;
